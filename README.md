# ML_Course_Code_Report

This is an attempt to repeat the results of Faber *et al.* ([JCTC 2017](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00577)) and Gilmer *et al.* ([ICML 2017](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/gilmer17a.html)). The initial commit of this repo is the original code report of a project of machine learining graduate course.

I major in physical chemistry; and I am not currently conducting research in the field of combinition of ML and chemistry. Therefore, I don't expect prefect repetition of these results.

`Faber_Code` directory includes Faber *et al.* ([JCTC 2017](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00577)) repetition. Only CM and BoB feature vectors generation have been realized by code in `Faber_Code/01-Feature_Vector`; only three lines in Table 3 in Faber *et al.* ([JCTC 2017](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00577)) have been reproduced by code in `Faber_Code/02-Repeat_Table3`. Other work in Faber *et al.* ([JCTC 2017](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00577)) hasn't been conducted now.

The code in `Gilmer_Code` is actually a simple clone from [Microsoft/gated-graph-neural-network-samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/gated-graph-neural-network-samples). Actually I don't comprehend the principle of Tensorflow, so I'm not able to understand the code of theirs. So none of the results in Gilmer *et al.* ([ICML 2017](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/gilmer17a.html)) have been successfully repeated.

Documentation and explanation of these codes or their functionalities are included in `tex/Code_Report.pdf`, written in Chinese. Additionally, the blog in [ajz34.github.io](https://ajz34.github.io/post/Faber-Repetition/) may have more explanation on Faber *et al.* ([JCTC 2017](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00577)). The blog there is also written in Chinese.
